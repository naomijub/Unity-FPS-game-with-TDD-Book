# Target Audience

For a long period of time, the gaming industry seemed resistant to agile methodologies, sadly, it seems to come from a few frustrated attempts to introduce agile methodologies in daily routines. I believe that this failed attempts happened because people did not try to adapt the frameworks to their worlds or people tried to introduce "the agile" framework as unique and undivisible thing, which made people see the framework as more than it really is and forgetting from where agile methodologies come from, the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/iso/ptbr/manifesto.html).

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools 
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation 
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation 
* **Responding to change over** following a plan

What seems to have been the most common error is the inversion right in the first line of the manifesto, since it seems that the game development world was going "processes and tools over individuals and interactions". More than that, the industry took processes, tools and frameworks in a quite rigid and inflexible perspective, which is pretty sad, being such a dynamic industry. There was even an article, Agile Game Development is Hard by Rob Galanakis, in 2014, demonstrating the anti-agile mindset. Happily, in the past 5 years I have seen a great amount of change in this context, which makes strategies like TDD for game development something more useful and welcomed in a more friendly manner to the gaming industry.

Besides that, I see TDD (test driven development) as a manifestation of the second principle in the manifesto. I believe this is due to the fact that a well tested code can be seen as documentation, proves the code is working and it has a minimal standard of quality. 

Having said that, I believe this book is great for everyone that wishes to improve their coding skills, learn TDD and learn Unity Development. Beginners will have the opportunity the learn step by step how to develop a game with detailed explanations over the language and tooling used, more advanced users will have a nice alternative to learn TDD, indie developer will be able to improve their testing skill, and for big studios this book is an opportunity to improve the general code quality and challenge their developers.
